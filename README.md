# University Project

### About:
This project was completed for the User Experience Design class at my university. The project focuses on improving the user experience and user interface of an existing website. The previous website had all of the information consolidated onto a single page. This project is an interactive prototype of the newly designed website for the island. The Guerilla Usability Testing pdf includes the testing conducted to determine how the user experience of the Taniti website prototype could be improved. Actionable feedback from the test results were incorporated into the final web design. The Design Document pdf includes wireframes and a user persona for the project.
